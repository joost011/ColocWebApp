        <h3 class="px-5">Welcome to ColocAPI</h3>
        <p class="px-5">
            Coloc API allows for colocalization analysis to compare genetic associations datasets (e.g. GWAS and eQTL).
            It returns summary files and locus visualization plots to allow for detailed review of the results. The
            summary files are downloadable.
            For the eQTL association dataset, data from the eQTL consortium phase I is used. It contains summary
            statistics of 16.989 cis eQTL genes from 31.684 blood samples, making it the biggest eQTL dataset to date.
            More eQTL datasets are planned soon to be added.
            With coloc API you are able to upload your own GWAS summary statistics for the colocalization analysis. It
            supports human datasets in build GRCh37 or GRCh38. Different phenotypes (e.g. quantitative and case-control)
            for GWAS studies can be processed.
            For colocalization analysis, the coloc package is used to see if there is a common genetic causal variant in
            a given region. It is also possible to use the SuSIE approach to deal with multiple causal variants.

        <h3 class="px-5">User guide/Requirements</h3>
        <p class="px-5">
            The GWAS file should be in .csv, .txt or .tsv format (comma, tab separated?). Columns that should be present
            in the file and that are necessary for colocalization are: â€¦ .
            Select the correct type of phenotype for the GWAS study in the options. Sample size should be given as well.
            Currently, the assumption for the input data is that the population is European.
            If there is no column with MAF values present in the GWAS dataset, MAF values will be used from the eQTL
            dataset.
